-- DFHack-native implementation of the classic Quickfort utility (PRE-RELEASE)
--[====[

quickfort
=========
Processes Quickfort-style blueprint files. This is a pre-release -- not all
features are implemented yet.

Quickfort blueprints record what you want at each map coordinate in a
spreadsheet, storing the keys in a spreadsheet cell that you would press to make
something happen at that spot on the DF map. Quickfort runs in one of four
modes: ``dig``, ``build``, ``place``, or ``query``. ``dig`` designates tiles for
digging, ``build`` builds buildings and constructions, ``place`` places
stockpiles, and ``query`` changes building or stockpile settings. The mode is
determined by a marker in the upper-left cell of the spreadsheet (e.g.: ``#dig``
in cell ``A1``).

You can create these blueprints by hand or by using any spreadsheet application,
saving them as ``.xlsx`` or ``.csv`` files. You can also build your plan "for
real" in Dwarf Fortress, and then export your map using the DFHack
`blueprint plugin`_ for later replay. Blueprint files should go in the
``blueprints`` subfolder in the main DF folder.

For more details on blueprint file syntax, see the `Blueprints Guidebook`_ or
browse through the ready-to-use examples in the `blueprints/library`_ folder.

Usage:

**quickfort set [<key> <value>]**
    Allows you to modify the active quickfort configuration. Just run
    ``quickfort set`` to show current settings. See the Configuration section
    below for available keys and values.
**quickfort reset**
    Resets quickfort configuration to the defaults in ``quickfort.txt``.
**quickfort gui**
    Starts the quickfort dialog, where you can run blueprints from an
    interactive list.
**quickfort list [search string] [-m|--mode <mode>] [-l|--library] [-h|--hidden]**
    Lists blueprints in the ``blueprints`` folder. Blueprints are ``.csv`` files
    or sheets within ``.xlsx`` files that contain a ``#<mode>`` comment in the
    upper-left cell. By default, blueprints in the ``blueprints/library/``
    subfolder or blueprints that contain a ``hidden()`` marker in their modeline
    are not shown. Specify ``-l`` or ``-h`` to include library or hidden
    blueprints. The list can be filtered by a specified mode (e.g. "-m build")
    and/or a substring to search for in a path, filename, mode, or comment. The
    id numbers in the list may not be contiguous if there are hidden or filtered
    blueprints that are not being shown.
**quickfort <command> <list_num> [<options>]**
    Applies the blueprint with the number from the list command.
**quickfort <command> <filename> [-n|--name <name>] [<options>]**
    Applies a blueprint in the specified file. The optional ``name`` parameter
    can select a specific blueprint from a file that contains multiple
    blueprints with the format "sheetname/label", or just "/label" for .csv
    files. The label is defined in the blueprint modeline, defaulting to it's
    order in the sheet or file if not defined. If the -n parameter is not
    specified, the first blueprint in the first sheet is used.

**<command>** can be one of:

:run:     Applies the blueprint at your current cursor position. It doesn't
          matter which mode you are in. You just need an active cursor.
:orders:  Uses the manager interface to queue up orders for the specified
          build-mode blueprint.
:undo:    Applies the inverse of the specified blueprint. Dig tiles are
          undesignated, buildings are canceled or removed (depending on their
          construction status), and stockpiles are removed. There is no effect
          for query blueprints.

**<options>** can be zero or more of:

``-q``, ``--quiet``
    Don't report on what actions were taken (error messages are still shown).
``-v``, ``--verbose``
    Output extra debugging information. This is especially useful if the
    blueprint isn't being applied like you expect.

Configuration:

The quickfort script reads its startup configuration from the
``dfhack-config/quickfort/quickfort.txt`` file, which you can customize. The
following settings may be dynamically modified by the ``quickfort set`` command,
but settings changed with the ``quickfort set`` command will not change the
configuration stored in the file:

``blueprints_dir`` (default: 'blueprints')
    Directory tree to search for blueprints. Can be set to an absolute or
    relative path. If set to a relative path, resolves to a directory under the
    DF folder.
``buildings_use_blocks`` (default: 'true')
    Force all blueprint buildings that could be built with any building material
    to only use blocks. The prevents logs, boulders, and bars (e.g. potash and
    coal) from being wasted on constructions. If set to false, buildings will be
    built with any available building material.
``force_marker_mode`` (default: 'false')
    Set to "true" or "false". If true, will designate dig blueprints in marker
    mode. If false, only cells with dig codes explicitly prefixed with ``m``
    will be designated in marker mode.
``stockpiles_max_barrels``, ``stockpiles_max_bins``, and ``stockpiles_max_wheelbarrows`` (defaults: -1, -1, 0)
    Set to the maximum number of resources you want assigned to stockpiles of
    the relevant types. Set to -1 for DF defaults (number of stockpile tiles
    for stockpiles that take barrels and bins, 1 wheelbarrow for stone
    stockpiles). The default here for wheelbarrows is 0 since using wheelbarrows
    normally *decreases* the efficiency of your fort.

There is one other configuration file in the ``dfhack-config/quickfort`` folder:
`aliases.txt`_. It defines keycode shortcuts for query blueprints. The format
for this file is described in the file itself, and default aliases that all
players can use and build on is stored in
`hack/data/quickfort/aliases-common.txt`_.
